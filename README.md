# TTRPG-combat-tracker

this is just a passion project of mine, hopefully the instructions are strait forward enough.

for the purpses of this program, a legendary creature is any creature with a unique name.

this program works by getting the name/health of a race and applies that to all monsters with the same race. Legendary creatures  have their own unique health pool.

to change the PCs you have to replace the names in the file "PC names.txt"

to add more PCs just add them to "PC names.txt" seperated by commas

to remove PCs just remove the name from "PC names.txt"
