this is just a passion project of mine, hopefully the instructions are strait forward enough

to change the PCs you have to go into the code and change the names "Crazey", "Dwallin", "Eleody", "Ebony", and "Forg" (lines 289-305) 


if you have less players than me just deleate the three lines of code pertaining to them (ex: lines 305-307)
